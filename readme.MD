# GolfStats
## This was an early experiment with scrapping and cleaning large data sets for analysis

This is not a maintained project for golf fans looking to build their own fantasy datasets. It is designed to show data connections, json -> dataframe, and some data cleaning. But, because websites and libraries change over time, it may not work as a viable scraper in 2019 (and beyond).
